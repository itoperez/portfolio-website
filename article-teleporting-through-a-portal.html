                    >This tutorial is in reference to how teleportation works in my VR Game -
                    <a href="nyu-capstone.html">NYU Capstone Project</a>. In that game you are given a polaroid camera that you can use to take
                    pictures. Those pictures activate the several large polaroid portals located around the level. Flying through the portals
                    teleports you back to where the picture was taken.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although these portals were made for Unity VR, they can easily be used in 3D and 2D with little to no tweaking. They work with
                colliders meaning that all you have to do to activate them is walk through them (aka collide with them). The static portals will
                stay in place while the dynamic portals will track your movement in order to face you for a more seamless interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shown below is the <b>static portal</b> and <b>dynamic portal</b> we are going to be making followed by a look at a
                <b>fully incorporated version</b> from my <a href="nyu-capstone.html">NYU Capstone Project</a>.

            <!--Article Section 2-->
            <h3 id="section2">2 - Setting Up the Portal GameObject</h3>
            <p>
                Create or add a portal object, I’ll be using a flatten cube named ‘portal’ with a green material. The portal object will need a
                collider with its ‘Is Trigger’ box checked and a Rigidbody with its ‘Is Kinematic’ checked (so it stays anchored in place
                unaffected by external forces and so we can move in script). Create a new script named “PortalManager” saved in the Scripts
                folder and add it as a component to your portal. Whenever the player hits the collider on the portal it will trigger the
                teleporting which will be done through script.
            </p>
            <div class="article-image-block">
                <img src="img/article-teleporting-through-a-portal/a-ttap-img2.1-PortalGameObject.png" alt="" class="article-image-center" />
            </div>
            <p id="teleportToLocation">
                Additionally create an empty object and name it “Teleport To Location”. We’ll be using later in the script as a reference to
                where the portal should teleport you to. I set mine on top of the blue quad with the blue forward vector facing the red quad so
                that the player faces that after teleporting.
            </p>
            <div class="article-image-block">

            </div>

            <!--Article Section 3-->
            <h3 id="section3">3 - Setting Up TPTrigger GameObject</h3>
            <p>
                We now need to set up the trigger that will collide with the portal box collider trigger. Being teleported when your head goes
                through the portal made the most sense to me so we’ll make the trigger area around the Main Camera.
            </p>
            <p>
                Left click on the Main Camera in the XROrigin and Create Empty object named ‘TPTrigger’. Add a Sphere Collider component and
                resize it to roughly the size you think a head would be. Make sure the collider’s ‘Is Trigger’ box is checked.
            </p>
            <div class="article-image-block">
                <img src="img/article-teleporting-through-a-portal/a-ttap-img3.1-TPTrigger.png" alt="" class="article-image-center" />
            </div>
            <p>
                As is our Portal will be triggered by any object that has a collider with ‘Is Trigger’ checked. ‘TPTrigger’, both hand
                controllers, and the balls from earlier tutorials all meet this requirement. To ensure that only objects we want to teleport do
                teleport, we’re going to add a second requirement in the form of a
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Tags.html" target="_blank">Tag</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a new Tag by clicking the ‘Tag’ dropdown box, then ‘Add Tag…'. Click the + button under ‘Tags’ to add a new one, name it
                “Teleportable”, and click Save. Under the original ‘Tag’ dropdown box select the newly created “Teleportable” Tag.
            </p>
            <div class="article-image-block">
                <img src="img/article-teleporting-through-a-portal/a-ttap-img3.2-AddTag.png" alt="" class="article-image-center" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Now any object with a collider set to ‘Is Trigger’ and with the ‘Teleportable’ tag will be able to teleport through the Portal.
            </p>

                This section will start by building a basic <a href="#staticPortal">static portal</a> and then, if it fits your game, will add
                more code to make it a <a href="#dynamicPortal">dynamic portal</a> like the one I use in my VR Game -

                Open up the PortalManger script we added to the Portal GameObject, delete Start() we won’t be using, and add the following
                variable. It’s set to private so that no other script can edit it and is tagged with [SerializeFeild] to allow us to set it from

                function, this will be called any time a GameObject that has a collider with ‘Is Trigger’ collides with the collider of the
                GameObject this Script is attached to. That of course being the Portal GameObject’s box collider (also set to ‘Is Trigger’).
            </p>
            <p>
                All the colliders that collide with the Portal are temporarily saved as ‘other’ and you can access the GameObjects those ‘other’
                colliders are attached to. Check if the ‘other’ collider’s GameObject has a ‘Teleportable’ tag and if it does teleport that
                ‘other’ GameObject’s root transform to the ‘teleportToLocation’.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-root.html" target="_blank">Transform.root</a> because without
                it ‘other’ is just referencing the transform of the GameObject with the collider, in our case ‘TPTrigger’. We don’t want the
                transform of ‘TPTrigger’ but instead the transform of ‘XROrigin’ to be able to teleport it along with all its children. Root will
                return the topmost transform in the hierarchy.

            <p>
                This dynamic portal moves to look at you but stands still if you are close enough to allow you to interact with it. Skip this
                next paragraph to go straight into building but if you’re interested here’s the reasoning behind this design choice:
            </p>
            <p>
                <i
                    >In my game, portals are scattered around the level not necessarily in the sky but high enough that the player has to be in
                    ghost/flying mode to reach them. Flying is a fun mechanic but it's sort of difficult to maneuver because of the speed (what
                    makes it fun). My main reason for portals to look at the player was to better help them aim and hit the portal. It also
                    mostly solved a secondary issue where they shouldn’t access the back side of the portal (more below). A final happy accident
                    is that it made the portals look more magical, as if they were alive.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                To make the portal move to look at the player we’ll need two additional variables. The first will be to keep track of the object
                the portal should look at, in this case the ‘Player’s Head’. We’ll also need a ‘Look at Minimum Distance’ variable so that if the
                player gets close enough to the portal it will stop moving. This allows the player to interact with it by removing any jittery
                twitchiness you’d get from the portal snapping to look at you when you’re super close and slightly moving your head.
            </p>
            <div class="article-image-block">
                <img
                    src="img/article-teleporting-through-a-portal/a-ttap-img4.5-DynamicPortalVariables.png"

            <p>
                Create a new private void function named ‘PortalMovements()’ below OnTriggerEnter() that we’ll eventually call in Update(). In
                the function check to see if the
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Distance.html" target="_blank">Vector3.Distance()</a> between the
                transform.position (transform of the object this script is attached to aka the Portal) and the playerHead is greater than the
                lookAtMinDistance. If it is then use
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html" target="_blank">Transform.LookAt()</a> to make the

                run, and play. It should look a bit like this.

                Our portal now works better but there is a minor issue, you can still teleport if you approach the portal from the back side
                while inside the minimum distance. This is because the colliders can still overlap thus registering a collision.

                <i
                    >There are a couple fixes, the first and easiest would be to add a thicker backing to the portal so that an object will be
                    stopped by it and not hit the portal’s collider. This may be the solution for you, I couldn’t use this because my portals are
                    thin polaroids. A second solution, that I used for a while, was to check if the player was in front of the portal and if they
                    weren’t then I would snap the portal to face them. I didn’t like this as much because I know players are immensely curious
                    and would hate not being able to see the back side of the portal. My current solution is instead to check if the object to be
                    teleported is in front of the portal at the point of collision, that of course being OnTriggerEnter(), and then add that as a
                    condition to determine whether or not to teleport the object.</i

                In the OnTriggerEnter() create two new Vector3 variables. The first, ‘portalForward’, will get the forward vector of the
                transform this script is attached to using
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.TransformDirection.html" target="_blank"
                    >Transform.TransformDirection()</a
                >. That is, it will get the blue forward vector of the portal seen below.

            </div>
            <p>
                The second vector, ‘portalToOther’, can be calculated by subtracting the position of the ‘transform’ (portal) from the ‘other’
                (usually ‘<a href="#section3">TPTrigger</a>’ from above with the ‘Teleportable’ tag) collider. This vector’s direction points out
                from the portal to the other collider.

                What we're doing here is finding the dot product (<a
                    href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Dot.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    >Vector3.Dot</a
                >) between the vectors ‘portalForward’ and ‘portalToOther’, in that order. The dot product will return a positive number,
                negative number, or zero. We can use the sign on the number to determine whether the end position of the second vector is in
                front, behind, or perpendicular to the front side of the perpendicular plane to the first vector (the perpendicular plane to the
                ‘portalForward’ vector is the same plane the the portal is on). A positive number is returned when the two vectors are less than
                90 degrees apart (in front of the portal), a negative number when they are greater than 90 degrees apart (behind the portal), and
                zero if the vectors are exactly 90 degrees apart (perpendicular to the portal). Here is a
                <a href="https://www.falstad.com/dotproduct/" target="_blank">dot product visualization</a> that I hope helps (the red vector is
                ‘portalForward’ and the blue is ‘portalToOther’).

            <p>
                That’ll do it for preventing teleportation from the back side of the portal while allowing it from the front. Save your script
                and run your project. Test it by approaching from both sides. It should be working like this:

            <h3 id="section5">5 - Ideas and Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                <b>[1]</b> Linking up to portals. Easy enough just add a second portal. Issue here would be preventing the second portal you
                teleport to from immediately teleporting you back. A disabling timer might work but then there would be a portal cooldown
                preventing other objects from teleporting at the same time. Slightly better solution would be to add a script to all teleportable
                objects and after teleporting they are disabled from teleporting for a bit and can only teleport again after a OnTriggerExit()
                from the second portal. Or minecraft it and just use a countdown at the second portal before taking you back.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>[2]</b> Portal respects the location of where an object collides into the first portal and it spits out the object from the
                same location on the second portal. My idea would be to get the location of the collision in world space and translate it to a 2D
                Vector in local space with respect to the portal. Assuming the second portal is the same size (if not use multiple to rescale to
                correct size), use the 2D Vector with respect to that second portal in local space and then translate that position to a 3D
                Vector in worldspace and split out the object. That's sort of how I create ripples in the portal along with a shader to show the
                ripples. Exceptions include objects that need to stay grounded (XROrigin). They’ll have to ignore the Y height component and
                continue to be teleported to the ground in front of the portal.
            </p>

            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>
                To start we are going to need five variables, all private so that no other script can edit them and all tagged with
                [SerializeFeild] to allow us to set them in the Editor.
            </p>

                <i
                    ><u>Quick Tip 1</u> - [Tooltip(“...”)]: Tooltips aren’t necessary but are nice to have so that when we hover over a variable
                    in the Editor we can see what it is going to be used for like a hint or a note.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>photoCapture</b>: a script that manages taking pictures for the Polaroid camera and developing them. There is a boolean in
                this script that we want to reference that tells us when the portal can be active. In that script the boolean is false when no
                picture to teleport to has been taken or if a picture is currently being developed. It's set to true whenever a photo is fully
                developed. Link to PhotoCapture.<br />
                <b>XROrigin</b>: the player object that will be teleported through the portal.<br />
                <b>pictureTakenLocation</b>: the position and rotation that the player will teleport to.<br />
                <b>playerHead</b>: the object the portal will look at.<br />
                <b>lookAtMinDistance</b>: used to determine whether the portal should or shouldn’t face the player.
            </p>

            <h3>Portal Movements</h3>
            <p>
                Create a private PortalMovements() function that will be called every frame in the Update() function. Here we want to set up a
                couple rules for when a portal should face the player and when it should stand still. If you don’t want the portal to move at
                all, skip ahead to the OnTriggerEnter section.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are going to want to check if the
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Distance.html" target="_blank">Distance()</a> between the portal and
                the player’s head is greater than the lookAtMinDistance. If it is, we’ll use the
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html" target="_blank">LookAt()</a> function to have the portal
                (transform) face the playerHead. When you are less than or equal that minimum distance, then the portal needs to stand still to
                make teleporting and interacting with it possible.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Pic of If() Section</b></h2>
            <p>
                Inside our else statement the portal should stand still because the player is inside the minimum distance. But just in case there
                is the possibility that the player might want to sneak a peek behind the portal. Now that's not allowed because it's blank and
                ugly back there so to prevent that we’ll use the dot product to check if the player is in front or behind the portal. If the
                player steps behind the portal it will snap to face the player again.
            </p>

            <h2><b>Pic of Else() Section</b></h2>
            <p>
                This code snippet is taken directly from Unity’s documentation on how to use the
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Dot.html" target="_blank">Dot()</a> product function. I used their
                exact example and with our variables.
            </p>

            <h3>OnTrigger Functions</h3>
            <p>
                Below we will use two of the three Messages functions afforded to us when we use colliders with ‘Is Trigger’ checked. The two
                functions we will use are
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html" target="_blank">OnTriggerEnter()</a> and
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerExit.html" target="_blank">OnTriggerExit()</a> and there
                exist a third unused one called
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerStay.html" target="_blank">OnTriggerStay()</a>. Here is the
                full list documentation of all
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.html" target="_blank">Collider functions</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)</h3>
            <p>
                Using this function we can keep track of other objects (that have colliders) that collide with the portal collider (added above)
                attached to the same portal object this PortalManager script is attached to. What is really being kept track of is the other
                objects colliders which are stored in variable other.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help identify those other objects that collide with the portal will be checking for their gameObject name by using
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object-name.html" target="_blank">Object.name</a>
                or in our case other.gameObject.name (because variable other is of type Collider so we must use other.gameObject to get a
                reference the Object before we get the Object.name).
            </p>
            <h2><b>Pic of Controller Section</b></h2>
            <p>
                If you don’t plan on interacting with the portal to make ripples skip this code snippet. This Ripples Blog will teach you how to
                create a shader and script that your hand controllers can interact with to create a sort of ripple effect. Here’s a preview of
                the shader and script attached to a working polaroid portal.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Gif of ripple portal</b></h2>
            <p>
                We want to look out for our hand objects, in our case named “RightController” and “LeftController”, so that we can set them up to
                interact with the portal when they are colliding with it. When they collide with the portal we can switch their collider’s ‘Is
                Trigger’ flag to uncheck or false. This now allows our hands to have physical collisions and which we need to create ripples on
                the portal.
            </p>
            <h2><b>Pic of TPTrigger Section</b></h2>
            <p>
                Now to teleport the player to the pictureTakenLocation we’ll need to check if the gameObject that collided with the portal’s
                collider is named “TPTrigger” and if it is the we can set the position and rotation of the player or XROrigin to the position and
                rotation of the pictureTakenLocation.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my case I made the “TPTrigger” gameObject a child of the player main camera with a sphere collider roughly the size of a human
                head.
            </p>
            <h2><b>GIF of TPTrigger GO</b></h2>
            <p>
                <i
                    ><u>Quick Tip 3</u> - Hard Coding Strings: Best practice is to not hard code strings like we did for the RightContoller,
                    LeftController, and TPTrigger. This is because we might change the name of the gameObject in the Editor and accidentally
                    forget to change the name in any script that may want to find that object. Best practice may look like creating a public tags
                    class that all scripts reference for the names of objects scripts might want to find. The reason for this is if something
                    breaks you’ll only have to fix it in one place not in all the scripts where you hard coded a string.
                </i>
            </p>

            <h3>OnTriggerExit(Collider other)</h3>
            <p>
                Here we simply want to set hand controller colliders back to being triggers by checking or setting true their ‘Is Trigger’ flags.
                We do this to continue to prevent unwanted collisions with the rest of the level.
